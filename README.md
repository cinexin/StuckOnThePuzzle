1. What's this?
---------------
This is the version 0.1-alpha of a super-simple puzzle made with HTML5/JavaScript. Nothing more, nothing less.

2. What do I need to run it?
----------------------------
Just a browser and you --well, sadly, your browser cannot be Chrome / Chromium at this moment :(
Download the project, open the puzzle.html file and that's all

3. Mmm...I don't want to download the project

5. How can you/we can improve the game?
----------------------------------------
For instance...
- Adding more puzzles and letting the user to choose his favourite
- Making a better management of piece collisions (sigh!)
- Making it work properly in Chrome/Chromium (sigh! x2)
- Adding difficulty levels (by adding the number of pieces, for example)

6. Did you use any JS libraries for this?
------------------------------------------
Yep. The great iioEngine framework ( http://iioengine.com )

7. Why "Stuck On The Puzzle" if the puzzle is such an easy one?

You're right, this is only an excuse to honour the song in the Submarine OST by Alex Turner
